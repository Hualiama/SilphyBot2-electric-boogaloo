# SilphyBot2
This is a discord bot made for the community of SharaXOfficial.

## Features
- Record keeping for Strikes + Bans
- Automatic user verification checking (Makes sure they read the rules)
- Utility features

## Fun Facts
- Data is stored in a psycopg2 database
- The bot is hosted on a Server now instead of a Carbon's Raspberry pi
  - This is great because it uses much less power, and does not require me to keep my computer on 24/7, is what Carbon wrote, and is still kinda true, but I draw 200w with my servers
- This is a fork of Carbon's and is updated with ChatGPT
